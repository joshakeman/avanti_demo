Avanti Financial Group today announced appointments to its leadership team. The company, which plans to apply for a bank charter under Wyoming’s special-purpose depository institution law, expects to open its doors by early 2021 and to serve as a compliant bridge between digital assets and the U.S. dollar payments system.

“We have assembled a team of all-stars who have significant experience in regulated financial institutions,” said Caitlin Long, founder and CEO. “We’re building a bridge that doesn’t yet exist between two different financial systems, and this team has top-quality execution skills to do it.”

Members of the team will work along with Avanti’s technology partner, Blockstream. They are:
